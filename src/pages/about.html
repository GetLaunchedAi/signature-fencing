      <h2 class="cs-title">Built for Installers. Trusted by Homeowners.</h2>
      <p class="cs-text">
        At Signature Fencing, we specialize in premium vinyl and
        aluminum fencing systems engineered for real-world performance. Every
        product we offer, from fabricated panels to welded gates is shaped by
        decades of hands-on installation experience and refined by a deep
        understanding of what contractors, property owners, and distributors
        actually need on-site.
      </p>
      <p class="cs-text">
        We believe quality starts long before a fence is installed. That’s why
        we’ve brought fabrication, welding, powder coating, and packaging under
        one roof, giving us total control over the consistency, fit, and
        durability of every system we deliver. Whether you're building a
        residential backyard enclosure or a multi-property commercial fence
        line, we make sure each component arrives installer-ready and built to
        last.
      </p>
      <p class="cs-text">
        Our team is made up of professionals who’ve spent years in the field—not
        just on the factory floor. That perspective drives everything we do,
        from gate alignment and fastener selection to packaging that prevents
        damage and speeds up unloading. We're not just manufacturers, we’re
        problem solvers who design fencing with real-world challenges in mind.
      </p>
      <div class="cs-flex-group">
        <p class="cs-flex-p">
          Founded on the principle that quality work should be simple to install
          and built to perform, Signature Fencing continues to grow as a trusted
          partner for contractors, wholesalers, and homeowners who value
          precision, speed, and long-term reliability.
